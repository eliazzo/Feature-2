# Image carousel

This is an automated image carousel with user pause and play features, text desciption and navigation buttons.

## Description

This image carousel was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. All images belong to https://www.hockney.com/home. 

The images are positioned horizontally in a row but are only visible when contained within the "viewer". 

The nextImage and previousImage functions alter the css left property of the image list items (the images) so that different images are visible according to the value of the css left property.

A setInterval function calls the nextImage function every 5 seconds.

### Planning
* The planning process involved checking out other image carousels online. I looked at slideshow tutorials and the image carousels found on most retail websites.


### Building 
* I built image carousel skeleton using HTML. 
* I used CSS to adjust the visibility of the images and create a "viewer".
* I used JavaScript to make the carousel interactive.

### Debugging
* I commented almost every line of my JavaScript with a short explanation so that every step was clear to me.
