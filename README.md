# Image carousel

This is an automated image carousel with user pause and play features, text desciption and navigation buttons.

## Description

This image carousel was created using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. All images belong to https://www.hockney.com/home. The images are positioned horizontally in a row but are only visible when contained within the "viewer". 

The nextImage and previousImage functions alter the css left property of the image list items (the images) so that different images are visible according to the value of the css left property.

A setInterval function calls the nextImage function every 5 seconds.
